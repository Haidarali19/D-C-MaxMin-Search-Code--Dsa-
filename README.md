Hello! I'm Muhammad Haidar Althaaf Sutowo, and I currently attend Universitas Muhammadiyah Jakarta for my college education.
Thus, the description for this repository is as follows:

The work I completed for my Data Structure Algorithm challenge, which allowed me to write the MAXMIN Search algorithm, is contained in this repository.
I updated this code to include a quicksort sorting feature. It can therefore sort the data and look for the highest or lowest value.

that's all,
Thank You For your visit and your attention.

PS : Maybe i will include more code in this repsitory, thank you.
