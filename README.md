Hello! I'm Muhammad Haidar Althaaf Sutowo, and I currently attend Universitas Muhammadiyah Jakarta for my college education.
Thus, the description for this repository is as follows:

This repository contains the work I finished for my Data Structure Algorithm test which gave me the opportunity to build the MAXMIN Search algorithm. 
I focused the program's reach to the Max and Min values. Therefore, it is not for sorting like merge sort, quick sort, and others.  
But, It can still search for the highest or lowest value. Sure, I am using the C++ programming language in this code.

that's all,
Thank You For your visit and your attention.

PS : Maybe i will include more code in this repsitory, thank you.
